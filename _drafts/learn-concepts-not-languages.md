*Learn concepts, Not (Programming) languages*

People want to tell you that you need to learn *language x* to be relevant in the Software Engineering sector. Once you've learned your second language you'll quickly grasp that it actually boils down to simple principles that all of them offer even though they fall into different paradigmns

While some languages embrace an understandable amount of restrictions, the other half tends to loosen those restrictions up. Strong typing is a common occasion for such restrictions.

# Preface

Don't be confused by punctuation. Some languages 

// Semikolon

// Type Order java vs Rust vs Go vs python

# Assigning

Putting values into memory is an Essential Part of Programming. Saving your State is Not only important to the Human understanding of procedures, it is also allowes you to leave empty slots in your Program to be filled by User input. That is why almost All languages have a way of doing such things. For example you would do things like this in Java:

``` java
String name = "Alan";
```

Languages having a less typed approach to assignment often Fall Back on keywords like set, let, var or have No keyword at All, like python does.

# Statement vs. Values

// Why do some ifs have values

# Branching

// If statements; Ruby especially

// Switch statements; match

# Repeating

// Loops

// Functions

# Comments

"Code should speak for itself" is a nice idea, but it really doesnt hold in practice. You should comment *hard* Parts of your Code. But dont get me wrong - This doesnt mean you have to comment every line you write. For example this is a bad comment:

``` java
// set i to 2
int i = 2;
```

# Good Practice

Some concepts have turned Out to be so successful that it is considered a good habit of using them on your own. Generally speaking, it is good Not to Alter variables once you have assigned them. This thrives your Program complexity, eases up Error faultiness and makes debugging difficult.
