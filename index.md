My name is Laurin alias lausek. I am programming things since 2013 - mainly on the web - and turned my hobby into a job in 2015. Even though I am pretty familiar with SAP development using ABAP, I started turning away to backend development in 2019.

I am a big fan of Rust, Python, NeoVim, and Scandinavian languages, foremost Swedish.
